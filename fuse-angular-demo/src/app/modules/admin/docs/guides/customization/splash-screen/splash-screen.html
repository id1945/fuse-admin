            The <strong>splash screen</strong> is the screen that shows up when your app is loading. It's <strong>NOT</strong> just a cosmetic screen or something that you can
            make <em>faster</em>, it simply shows up while Angular loads and hides immediately after it finishes loading.
        </p>

        <h2>How it works?</h2>
        <p>
            When you first arrive your app via its website address, the <strong>index.html</strong> loads first. It has all the required scripts injected in it by the
            AngularCLI, so as soon as it loads, it also starts loading the required script files.
        </p>
        <p>
            After those required script files loaded, Angular starts the Bootstrapping progress and loads the first component (usually the <em>AppComponent</em>). Then
            <em>AppComponent</em> takes over and loads other modules and components and your app starts running.
        </p>
        <p>
            While all of these happening, you will see nothing on the screen simply because the <strong>index.html</strong> file has nothing in it except the script injections
            and the entry point for your <em>AppComponent</em>. That's where the <strong>splash screen</strong> comes into play and hides the <em>white screen of loading</em>.
        </p>

        <h2>Customizing the screen</h2>
        <p>
            Splash screen content stays in the <code>index.html</code> file. The <code>fuse-splash-screen</code> dummy element holds everything related to the splash screen.
            This element is not an actual Angular component, it's just a simple wrapper to hold everything you may want to show on the splash screen.
        </p>
        <p>
            Splash screen styles are located in <code>src/assets/styles/splash-screen.css</code> file.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can change the styles to modify the look of the splash screen and put anything you want into the <code>fuse-splash-screen</code> element to show on the
            page.
        </p>
        <fuse-alert
            [appearance]="'border'"
            [type]="'info'">
            Please note, you cannot run Angular components in here. Basically, by the time you can run Angular components, you won't be needing the
            splash screen because everything would already be loaded!
        </fuse-alert>
        <p>
            If you don't want to show the splash screen and you are happy with the <em>white screen of loading</em>, then you can simply remove the
            <code>fuse-splash-screen</code> dummy element and its content from the <strong>index.html</strong> file as well as the <code>link</code>
            element that loads the <code>splash-screen.css</code> file:
